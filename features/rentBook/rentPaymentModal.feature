# Feature: Payment modal for online payment

#     As a User, I want to view the payment modal so that I can pay
#     the total rent cost for book rent approved by the book owner.

#     Scenario: As a User I want to see proceed to checkout button if the book is approved
#         Given I am on the "dashboard" page
#         And I click the "rented-books-btn" button
#         When I click the "checkout-btn" button
#         Then I should see "pay-with-khalti-btn" button
